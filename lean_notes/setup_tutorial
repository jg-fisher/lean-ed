#### The steps, keys and the questions I ran into

#### Nix + Lean4 ####

Install nix and git

Enter nix shell

Initialize new nix flake and templated leanpkg

Ref Usage: https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/setup.html
opening into the "lean shell": 
- nix-shell https://github.com/leanprover/lean4/archive/master.tar.gz -A nix

Visual Studio Code: binary is built and opened automagically with
Editor: "nix run .#vscode-dev MyPackage.lean"

Keys to "nix build":
git add xxxx.lean (wasnt doing this before. do not copy the file like the first stream lol)
nix build .#executable
files must be added to git for the build command to work

configuring "lean4 extension": in vscode
run "elan which lean" and add that to your "extension settings"
in vscode, reload after updating path to the lean4 executable
"lean4 extension anage extension settings"
CTRL + SHFT + P -> Developer: Reload window
then reload the window
Visual Studio Code: Trusted window must be accepted to enable the lean4 extension (a prompt page inside your editor shoud load with this option)
trust and reload extension (extension tab)

#### Question and Answers During Streams: ####
